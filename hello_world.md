A mandatory step in learning a new technology in computer science is to
run a 'hello world' example. Your first step in bash should be no exception.
Open a bash shell and type everything after the `$` sign and hit return.
The shell should greet you and everybody else in the world as shown in
this example.
<!-- console_output -->
```bash
$ echo "Hello World!"
Hello World!
```
